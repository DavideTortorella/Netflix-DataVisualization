Starting from the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows), the *goal* was to create an Interactive Dashboard in order to 
provide advices to produce a "Successful Show". 
The audience is then a plausible Content-Maker.

## Description
The project was developed via [LookerStudio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/), a software for visualizations provided by Google.

The main features analysed were:
- Ranking of Movies and Tv-Series over time (from 1945 to 2020)
- Median Ranking per Genre 
- Actors
- Production Countries divided per Genre
- Evolution of Runtime over time
- Ranking according to Release's Month
